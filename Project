                    <h3>Panda</h3>
                    <h5>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to
                    China. It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. Its body is
                    rotund; adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in)
                    long. It is sexually dimorphic, with males being typically 10 to 20% larger than females. A thumb is visible on its
                    forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. It has large molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to
                    meet its dietary requirements. It can digest starch and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost entirely of
                    bamboo and bamboo shoots.
                    
                    The giant panda lives exclusively in six montane regions in a few Chinese provinces at elevations of up to 3,000 m
                    (9,800 ft). It is solitary and gathers only in mating seasons. It relies on olfactory communication to communicate and
                    uses scent marks as chemical cues and on landmarks like rocks or trees. Females rear cubs for an average of 18 to 24
                    months. The oldest known giant panda was 38 years old.</h5>

                    <h3>Tiger</h3>
                    <h5>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful,
                        muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is
                        traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian
                        tigers
                        and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.
                
                        Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed
                        forests in
                        the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian
                        subcontinent
                        and Southeast Asia.
                    The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life
                    and occupies home ranges, defending these from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male tiger overlaps with that
                    of multiple females with whom he mates. Females give birth to usually two or three cubs that stay with their mother for
                    about two years. When becoming independent, they leave their mother's home range and establish their own.
                    
                    Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are locally extinct
                    in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger's range is
                    severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, as its range is thought to
                    have declined by 53% to 68% since the late 1990s. Major threats to tigers are habitat destruction and fragmentation due
                    to deforestation, poaching for fur and the illegal trade of body parts for medicinal purposes. Tigers are also victims
                    of humanâ€“wildlife conflict as they attack and prey on livestock in areas where natural prey is scarce. The tiger is
                    legally protected in all range countries. National conservation measures consist of action plans, anti-poaching patrols
                    and schemes for monitoring tiger populations. In several range countries, wildlife corridors have been established and
                    tiger reintroduction is planned.</h5>
