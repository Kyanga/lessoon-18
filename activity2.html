    <h3>Tiger</h3>
    <h5>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful,
    muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is
    traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers
    and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.
    
    Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in
    the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent
    and Southeast Asia.</h5>

        <h3>Tiger</h3>
        <h5>The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life
        and occupies home ranges, defending these from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male tiger overlaps with that
        of multiple females with whom he mates. Females give birth to usually two or three cubs that stay with their mother for
        about two years. When becoming independent, they leave their mother's home range and establish their own.
        
        Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are locally extinct
        in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger's range is
        severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, as its range is thought to
        have declined by 53% to 68% since the late 1990s. Major threats to tigers are habitat destruction and fragmentation due
        to deforestation, poaching for fur and the illegal trade of body parts for medicinal purposes. Tigers are also victims
        of humanâ€“wildlife conflict as they attack and prey on livestock in areas where natural prey is scarce. The tiger is
        legally protected in all range countries. National conservation measures consist of action plans, anti-poaching patrols
        and schemes for monitoring tiger populations. In several range countries, wildlife corridors have been established and
        tiger reintroduction is planned.</h5>
